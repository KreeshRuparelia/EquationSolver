**Linear Equation Solver**

**DESCRIPTION:**
The EquationSolver project allows the user to choose between solving a linear equation or
test their skill using the 'QUIZ' feature.


**TRY IT OUT!**
In order to test out the **Linear Equation Solver** for yourself, you must have Java installed on your computer. Upon
installing java, you can download all the files from the repository and open them up (ensure all files are in the
same folder) using your IDE (Integrated Developement Environment) of choice. Upon opening up the project, go over
and select the file *EquationCalculator.java* which is the main class and run the file. Running *EquationCalculator.java* 
will prompt you with the choice to either solve linear equations or quiz your knowledge, you can select either,
typing **S** allows you to solve linear equations and, typing **Q** allows you to use the quiz feature. To switch between 
the two, run the file again. 

**Solve (S):**
If you wish to solve linear equations, there is a sample test cases file available on the repository page to help you
get started. You can also try writing any equation of choice and the program will solve it for you. Please ensure the unknown
variable is **x** and **x** is only one side (doesn't matter left or right).


**Quiz (Q)**
If you wish to quiz your linear equation solving skils, you can use the quiz feature which prompts you with the option
to solve One Step, Two Step, or Multi-Step equations. After you feel that you are done, you can type **'QUIT'** to exit the
program.


**LOGIC / TECHNICAL ASPECT:**
Developing this program was a particularly difficult challenge as it was my first time developing a project in Java
with Object Oriented Programming approach. During the project I was also able to learn about regex, switch cases, array lists,
and java arrays.
