A FEW DISCLAIMERS:

1. All test cases including "+" also work with "-", a "+" is used to reduce clutter and present a more
diverse set of test cases without causing clutter.

2. All numbers and 'x' terms are presented as either negative or positive values, however, they work just 
as well with the the sign switched (unless otherwise specified).


Example Test Cases:

x = 5
x + -5 = 10
5x = -10
x/3 = 10
-5x + 4 = 14
-x/3 + -1 = 2

(x - 3)/5 = 20
	- NOTE: Negative x doesn't work in brackets

2(x + 2) = -14
2/-x = 4
2(x - -3)/4 = 5
3/-x = -5/4
-2x/-3 + 1/-2 = 3/-4


SPECIAL CASES:

2x + 4 - 5 + 3x + 5.... = 5

My code is able to handle multiple unknowns and constants as I am able to group like terms
using for loops and ArrayLists. However, my code can't group unknowns accurately if there is an unknown
in the denominator or bracket, in which scenario, I can only do the standard of one unknown (but I can still handle
multiple constants).
